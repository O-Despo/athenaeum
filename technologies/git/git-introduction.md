History is stored as compressed collectoin of interrelated snapshots of project content. each version is a *commit*.

You can work in a different branch if you want to make seperate changes.

*branch*: a list of commits that deffers from the main head

*head*: the refernece to the lastest commits in a branch

`git branch`: Shows all branch heads

*tags*: like heads but reff a certain point in history instead of the lastest commit
