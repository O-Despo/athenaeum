# Introduction

- After being professor worked as quant at D. E. Shaw hedge fund
- In 2008 market crash it became clear that math was intertwined with world problems
- Instead of reflecting after 2008 we leaned into models

- The models are thought of as: fair, objective, fast
- Embed human prejudice
- Punish the poor
- **WMD**: weapon of math destruction
- These models are treated as if they are objective and are unquestioned

## DC 2007

- Adrian Fenty was mayor
- Fentys goal: fix schools - get rid of bad teachers - move good ones - optimize system
- Fenty hires Michele Rhee as chancellor of Washington schools
- Rhee hires Mathematica Policy Research out of Princeton
- The make a model called IMPACT -> scores teachers
- In 2009-10 fires bottom 2%, 2010-2011 5%
- Good teachers booted
- Sarah Wysoki was very good teacher
- Sarah got fired, wanted answers
- Got brick wall: model is complex: trade secrets
- Reducing human behaviors to a few variables is hard
- The school system is very complex circumstance
- **It defined its own reality and use it to justify there own results**
- **Instead of searching for the truth the score comes to embody it** 
- There is not statistical vigor in testing only 30 students with a teacher
- We can not implement systems like we are in a data rich environment when we are not
- The students that entered the class performed very well the year before
- Washington post found up to 70% corrected tests
- Teachers money and lively hood on the line (this was in the middle of a recession)
- Teacher were considered collateral damage
- Sarah moved to school w/o IMPACT which was more wealthy


## Feedback loops
- Many models have feedback loops
- The data that is learned from is defined by the model
- Minimizes human bias -> Maximizes machine bias
- Rich people are processed by people: poor people are processed by machines
- Models are scaleable cheap and fast

## Take away

1. Models have proliferated to every corner of the modern world
2. Models are presented as objective, fair, and fast
3. Models are unquestioned
4. Models harm the poor and embed human prejudice
5. People are held to a higher standard of proof than the model
6. Collateral damage as a rule is accepted
