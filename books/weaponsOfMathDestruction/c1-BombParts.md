# Chapter 1: Bomb Parts

## Baseball

- Major league baseball is widly and effectivly modeld
- This is used to maximize the chance of wininig
- Baseball models are not WMD b/c
- The data is transparent
- Statistical rigor
- Large dataset
- The data is always pouring in. Feedback
- **The data is reavent to the outcomes they are trying to maximize**
- WMD often used proxies b/c there is not enough usefull data
- **Conditions change so must the model**


- *Model*: a abstract representations of somoe process
- There are many "informal" models we use every day
- An example being how to cook for a fainmly
- **Dynamic model**: a model that updates and makes adjustments as time goes on 
- If you would me this a rigorouse process there would still be mistakes as there will be details missed
- **by there nature models are simplifications**
- no model can include all real world complexity and nuance
- A models blind spots are chosen so they mirror creators inteest
- Google maps dose not care about building it is not needed
- you choose blindspots **scarifcing acuracy for effinecny**
- **models reflect foeals and ideoly**
- The success of a model is defined by the creator
- North Korea would defined success by the least cost to keep you from death when eating
- simple models can be effective: fire alarms
- One variable (smoke) points to one source (fire)

## Racism

- You could look at racism like a model in a few billion people
- It is based on impcomlete, false, and gernalized data
- This data points to the idea a group of people are bad (and all poeple like them are bad)
- Racists do not look for new data: it would make them no longer racist

### Texas

- 1997
- Duane Buck African American man killed 2
- Jury deciding between death sentence and life in prison
- Defence brought forward psychologist Walter Quijano
- Quinjano testifies that because of his race he would end up killing again
- Recidivsm rates
- 3 years later John Cornyn Texas attorny gernal that he had given 12 race based testimorney
- Cornyn ordered new race-blind hearings
- Buck never got a retrial
- According to the American Civil Libertaiens union secntinsn for black men in federal systems were 20 percent longet ean those for whites of the same crime

### Compute system

- To fix problem recidivism models we introduced in 24 states
- Did we fix the issue of cloak it in technology
- Very few see interal workings
- I popular model is LSI-R (level of Service Invertor- Revised)
- Some questions like first interaction with police favor rich white
- Not all states use it for sentencing
- These questions bring upbringing, circumstacne, and inderectly race into the process of judgeing how long somoenes sencetce should be
- It creates a feedback loop, Poor -> jail longer -> poor

## Summary

- MWD's are spreading

### healthy model

- Transparent
- Updated
- an asumstions and conclutions are clear to see and fair
- Dont rely on proxies

### Unhealthy model

- If the person knows they are being modeled what is it used for, it is transparent, or even hidden? Is it harmful?
- Dose the model work against the subjects interest?
- Can the model scale?: how many can it effect
- WMD: opacity, scale, damage
